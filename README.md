# Vision-Aided-Navigation-Visual-SLAM-
This project implements a complete Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) system designed to estimate the trajectory of a vehicle using stereo camera data. The system evolves from basic feature tracking into a robust navigation engine using factor graph optimization.
